# Hello-World
Learning workflow of github
My name is Wesley Gifford
Im a junior in college studying Computer Science
Being 3 years into this I still feel like I know nothing about coding
I don't know what kinda job i'd wanna do with it, aside from the basic kids dream of making a game
I know that's not really viable and that I should look for an actual career in it
So im hoping to use this to figure out what I might wanna do and hopfully get some personal projects started
